# implementation of CNN snake using pytorch

this base of this code was made by Patrick Loeber, and can be found here https://github.com/patrickloeber/snake-ai-pytorch

I have already made an implementation of a CNN snake using tensorflow, but it ran too slowly so I decided to make another implementation using pytorch.
My reasoning was that pytorch has better supposed for cuda, and using cuda I would be able to cut runtimes to a more reasonable number.
Patrick's code has set up the basic q-learning parameters and snakegame, although I had to greatly alter both the game and model for my purposes.

reach out if there are any questions or bugs regarding the code
